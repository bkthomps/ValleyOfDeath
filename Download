Since the file is too large, I put it on Google Drive. When downloading, keep the two folders and the exe in the folder called ValleyOfDeath. The folder will need to be un-zipped. Then just play the exe file and the iPhone App will play. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_vswrjBhyxUNWlSMkFKWG1OeUU/view?usp=sharing

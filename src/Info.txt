You take control of an airship to battle waves of enemies, unlocking new ships as you progress. You can play a story mode, as well as an endless mode. To top it off, there is a soundtrack.

This is a scrolling shooter iPhone app. The user has the ability to play story mode. In this mode, the user must make
decisions which will lead to the outcome of the story. Every once in a while, the decisions that the user has made will
result in an encounter, be it a scrolling shooter level, or a torture scene. There is also an endless mode, in which the
user must endlessly shoot enemy spaceship until the user dies. Doing this, the user will gain experience points, and be
able to level up. There are 20 levels, and every few levels, the user will unlock a new ship. In total, there are 8
different ships. Each ship has a different amount of health, has a different speed, and has a different amount of guns.
On top of this, there is also a sound track with many different songs. The song will switch every so often when the
user is in a non-critical point, as to not lag the game. The user also has the ability to mute the soundtrack by going
into the options menu, and can also reset all game data if the user so wishes.

# ValleyOfDeath
This was made in C++ using DragonFireSDK. I regret to say that the code is inefficient in many places, such as the amount of global variables it uses; however, I made this in 2014. I am now more experienced, and my code is now much more efficient. When I get DragonFire SDK again, I will go through the code and make it more efficient.
